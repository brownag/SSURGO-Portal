# package_files.py
# Create Python Zip file with a root __main__.py 
# and contents of specified folder tree.
# Usage:
#   package_files.py <root of file tree> <file to create>
# For example, if you are executing in the folder above the PYZ file assemblage 
# (located in child folder "pyz") and want to create "test.pyz" in your current 
# location, use
#   package_files.py pyz test.pyz
# Notes: 
#   1. The zip contents starts within the root path.
