If executed at a command prompt, the DP/DL behavior may be selected by 
choosing one  of the following forms, where "<script>" is the name of 
the Python script that you are currently running:
  <script>
       - start SSURGO Portal UI
  <script> ?requestName   (or any text starting with a character other than "@")
       - If requestame is omitted then return pretty-printed usage syntax plus 
         a list of the available request names.
       - if the "?" is immediately followed by the name of a JSON request, 
        the request and response schemas are presented for that request,
        if the request name is invalid an error is shown. For example,
          <script> ?getstatus
  <script> @x01.txt
		- read DL input from x01.txt 
  <script> @ < x01.txt
		- read file x01.txt via STDIN 
  type x01.txt | <script> @
		- read piped-in (i.e., stdin) text from x01.txt

Note that the JSON requests and responses may include "comment" 
items. These are for documentation purposes and are ignored by this script. 
The names of the requests are handled in a case-blind manner.
In general empty response items are omitted (unless verbose is set true).

The simplest JSON request looks like this:
    {
      "request": "getstatus"
    }
and the response will be similar to:
    {
        'status': True, 
        'message': "It's alive! 
            runmode=RunMode.DATA_LOADER, 
            isPyz=False, __file__=C:\\ notes\\2022\\05\\Gaia-1882\\pyz\\dlcore\\dlutilities.py, 
            currentPath=C:\\ notes\\2022\\05\\Gaia-1882\\pyz",
        'errormessage': ""
    }
